My fucking mentor texted me and threatened me that he will take legal actions if 
I don't delete files related to the company from my github.

Damn fool man, he could just have asked to politely to remove it rather than 
threatening me.


Screw you MR.Mentor!!!


Wait why am I spoiling my mood because of you...hehehehe, I don't care what you're 
gonna do to me, cuz those were the initial commits of my repository and If you 
have eyes than you can check it out in my later commits of that repo that I have 
created a gitignore file for that file idiot.
But I forgot to remove my commit history, and since I have deleted all the commit 
history I don't expect you messages now.... God please save me from this idiot guy...
